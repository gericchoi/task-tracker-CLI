# Technical Skills Demonstrated in Task CLI Project

This document outlines the various technical skills and concepts that were practiced and implemented through the development of the Task CLI project.

## PHP Development

- **Core PHP Programming**: Implemented functions, arrays, conditionals, loops, and file handling operations
- **Command-line PHP (CLI)**: Built a PHP application that runs in a command-line environment, useful for backend scripting and task automation
- **Working with JSON**: Handled JSON files as a storage method for tasks, applicable to data storage, APIs, and database interactions
- **Error Handling and Validation**: Implemented user input validation and comprehensive error handling to create a robust application

## File Handling and Persistence

- **Reading and Writing Files**: Gained experience with file I/O operations through the `readTask()` and `writeTask()` functions
- **Data Persistence**: Implemented a system to store task data between application sessions
- **JSON Data Management**: Learned to serialize and deserialize data using PHP's JSON functions to maintain task information

## Data Structures and Algorithms

- **Array Manipulation**: Used arrays extensively to store, retrieve, and manipulate tasks
- **Search and Update Algorithms**: Created functions like `findTask()` and `setTask()` to locate and modify data in collections
- **Data Transformation**: Converted between different data formats (PHP arrays to/from JSON)

## Task Automation and Scripting

- **CLI Automation**: Created a command-line tool that automates repetitive task management processes
- **Task Scheduling & Status Tracking**: Implemented a stateful system to track and update task progress

## Software Design & Architecture

- **Modular Design**: Broke down the project into separate functional components (helper functions, validation, task actions, display functions)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Organized functions by their responsibilities for clean and maintainable code
- **Command Pattern**: Implemented a command-based architecture for handling different task operations

## Problem-Solving & Debugging

- **Error Handling**: Anticipated and managed edge cases like invalid task IDs or missing statuses
- **Troubleshooting**: Solved challenges related to input validation, file handling, and task management
- **Input Validation**: Created robust validation functions to ensure data integrity

## User Interface Design (CLI-based)

- **Command-Line Interface**: Created a user-friendly interface for interaction in a non-graphical environment
- **User Experience**: Designed clear command patterns and feedback messages for improved usability

## Time Management Integration

- **Timestamp Implementation**: Added creation and update timestamps to tasks for tracking changes over time
- **Temporal Data**: Incorporated date/time elements into the data structure

## Project Management Skills

- **Feature Planning**: Implemented various functionalities (add, update, delete, list, mark) based on project requirements
- **Workflow Optimization**: Developed a tool to simplify everyday task management and tracking

## Software Development Best Practices

- **Function Reusability**: Created reusable functions for common operations
- **Consistent Coding Style**: Maintained a consistent coding style throughout the project
- **Documentation**: Added appropriate comments and created documentation (README)
